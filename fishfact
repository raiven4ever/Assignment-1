Fish play diverse and significant roles in our society.
Here in Canada, theyâ€™re the third most popular pet after cats and dogs, and the second most common research model after mice.
Millions are caught recreationally across the country every year, while at least a billion more are farmed and caught commercially.
Fish are also essential to the ocean, lake and river ecosystems that we depend on.
